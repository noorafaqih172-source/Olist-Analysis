# Olist Analysis 2016 - 2018

## Project Overview
This project investigate Olist company pricing strategy in Brazil between 2016 until 2018

### Introduction
Olist is one of Brazil’s leading e-commerce ecosystem companies, connecting small and medium-sized sellers with major online marketplaces. Through a scalable B2B model, Olist enables merchants to list, manage, and sell their products online without needing a physical storefront. Customers browse, order, and pay through digital platforms, while sellers benefit from streamlined workflows, logistics integrations, and tools that improve operational efficiency.

### Scenario
Olist is a Brazilian e-commerce platform currently using experience-based pricing, which leads to inconsistencies across products and regions.This project aims to build a data-driven pricing model that optimizes product prices across states and categories.

### Approaches
1- Are vouchers distributed equally across states and categories?

2- Are vouchers being misused by customers?

3- Are vouchers distributed evenly throughout the year?

4- Do installments generate more income?

5- Which states and categories rely most on installments?
